# Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) CLI

A pure MLX implementation of RVC for Apple Silicon.

## About

This project is a fork of [Applio](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio). We chose to base this implementation on Applio to keep pace with the latest RVC developments, as they have become the primary maintainers since the [original RVC project](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/) went dark.
